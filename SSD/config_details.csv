img_height : Height of the input images
img_width : Width of the input images
img_channels : Number of color channels of the input images
intensity_mean:Set this to your preference (maybe `None`). The current settings transform the input pixel values to the interval `[-1,1]`.
intensity_range : Set this to your preference (maybe `None`). The current settings transform the input pixel values to the interval `[-1,1]`.
n_classes : Number of positive classes

scales : An explicit list of anchor box scaling factors. If this is passed, it will override `min_scale` and `max_scale`.
aspect_ratios :The list of aspect ratios for the anchor boxes

two_boxes_for_ar1 = True : Whether or not you want to generate two anchor boxes for aspect ratio 1
steps : In case you'd like to set the step sizes for the anchor box grids manually; not recommended
offsets : In case you'd like to set the offsets for the anchor box grids manually; not recommended
clip_boxes : Whether or not to clip the anchor boxes to lie entirely within the image boundaries
variances : The list of variances by which the encoded target coordinates are scaled
normalize_coords : Whether or not the model is supposed to use coordinates relative to the image size
